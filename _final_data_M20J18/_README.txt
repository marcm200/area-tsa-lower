Reliable interior of the quadratic Mandelbrot set.

Entire image of 2^20 x 2^20 pixels.

A pixel represents a small complex interval of side length 4/2^20 and its
color denotes the common fate of ALL underlying complex numbers.

Black = definitely interior (or boundary).
Gray = unjudged.

Image was tiled into chunks of size 2^15 x 2^15 pixels.

File name indicates position of the lower left pixel of the chunk image in absolute coordinates.

Lower left pixel is 0,0 (either relative to file name in case of the chunks) or absolute in
the entire image.

Lower left corner of the lower left pixel of the entire image represents -2-2*i.

Only lower complex half was analyzed due to symmetry.

Missing files are fully GRAY and do not contain detectable
interior at current level M20J18.

No black pixel is inside or overlaps with the boundary of the
main cardioid or period-2 bulb.
